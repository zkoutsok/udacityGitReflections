What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
A new snapshot of the directory is created. I need to do it in case i want to track the versions of all the files in the repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Staging area is not an existing directory, its a temporary area to hold the files that are modified and to be commited.
